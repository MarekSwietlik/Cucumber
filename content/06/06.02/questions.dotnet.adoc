==== Lesson 2 - Questions

===== Which of the commands below would run all scenarios NOT tagged with @slow when executed from a SpecFlow project folder that has been configured to use MsTest?

* dotnet test --filter Category!=slow
* dotnet test --filter TestCategory!=slow ----TRUE
* dotnet test --filter TestCategory!=@slow
* dotnet test --filter -Trait:slow

Explanation:
SpecFlow converts the tags to test categories for the configured test execution framework. When using `dotnet test`, the filter expression syntax to be used to filter for the category depends on the on the test execution framework. With MsTest and NUnit, the `TestCategory` keyword has to be used and xUnit uses 'Category'. 

For the test category expression the `=` and the `!=` operators can be used, but the tag name has to be provided without the `@` character. 

The trait expressions used in Visual Studio Test Explorer cannot be used for `dotnet test`.
